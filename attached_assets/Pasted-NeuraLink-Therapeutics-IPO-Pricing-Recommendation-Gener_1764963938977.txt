VERIFICATION REPORT: NeuraLink Therapeutics IPO Output

Overall Assessment: FLAWED but with correctable logic. The output demonstrates a fundamentally broken valuation model for biotech, with critical omissions that make the recommendation unusable.

Critical Errors & Omissions:
1. COMPLETE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT rNPV VALUATION

Input: Explicitly stated "Use rNPV as primary valuation method" with specific probabilities of success (55% for Phase 3, 35% for Phase 2) and peak sales projections.

Output: raNPV/share: $0.00 and NTM EV/Revenue: 0.0× for all scenarios.

Analysis: This is the core failure. The app ignored the most important biotech valuation methodology. An rNPV model would discount future cash flows by probability and time. The $0.00 output suggests the app either cannot handle pre-revenue models or ignored the instruction entirely. This makes all valuation metrics meaningless.

2. MISAPPLIED "DUAL-CLASS" DISCOUNT & FOUNDER CONTROL

Input: Founders have a dual-class structure (10x voting power) with a control threshold of 30% post-IPO.

Output: Warns founders are below "50% control threshold" (wrong number) and states "Dual-class governance discount applied: -0%".

Analysis:

Wrong Threshold: The input's concern is staying above 30% voting control, not 50% economic ownership. With 10x voting power, 13.8% economic ownership = ~58.1% voting power (13.8% * 10 / (13.8%*10 + 86.2%*1)). The founders comfortably retain control. The app missed this completely.

Misplaced Discount: A dual-class structure typically warrants a governance discount (e.g., 5-20%) to the valuation, not a 0% discount. The output acknowledges the discount but applies none.

3. IGNORED CASH RUNWAY SENSITIVITY & BINARY EVENT RISK

Input: Required "cash runway sensitivity analysis" and "heavy discount for binary FDA risk (-30% to base case)" with a PDUFA date in 9 months.

Output: No runway analysis shown. The "Catalyst risk: -1%" is trivial and not modeled into the price. The post-IPO cash is simply stated as $938.8M.

Analysis: The key rationale for the $550M raise was to extend the ~18-month runway. At a burn of $210M/year, $938.8M cash provides ~4.5 years of runway, which is strong. However, the 30% FDA risk discount was not applied to the valuation, a major oversight.

4. COMPARABLE ANALYSIS IS BROKEN

Input: Provided both revenue multiples (for commercial peers) and peak sales multiples (12-15x for Phase 3 biotech).

Output: Uses Peer Median EV/Rev 13.3x (likely an average of the listed revenue multiples) and compares it to a $0 revenue company, resulting in 0.0× multiples.

Analysis: For a pre-revenue biotech, comparables should be based on peak sales multiples or pipeline value. Using revenue multiples against zero revenue is nonsensical and generates useless metrics (0% above peer median).

5. SHARE COUNT & PRICE MECHANICS (The one correct part)

Calculations are arithmetically sound:

Primary Shares: $550M / $8 = 68.75M ✓

Secondary Shares: $120M / $8 = 15.00M ✓

Greenshoe: 12.5% * (68.75M + 15.00M) = 10.47M (The output's 8.59M is slightly off; should be 10.47M).

Post-IPO FD Shares: 103.5M (pre-IPO) + 68.75M + 10.47M = 182.72M (close to output's 180.84M).

Founder Ownership: (15.2M + 9.8M) / 182.72M = 13.7% ✓

Post-IPO Cash: $320M (current) + $550M (primary) + ($10.47M * $8) (greenshoe) = $963.8M (output is close).

6. IMPLIED VALUE PER PATIENT (Missing)

The special request to calculate "implied valuation per enrolled Phase 3 patient" was completely ignored.

Corrected, Logical Output Summary:
A proper analysis for NeuraLink Therapeutics would look very different:

Valuation (rNPV-Based):

Base Case rNPV: Calculate using peak sales ($2.8B), probabilities (55%, 35%), discount rate (16.2%), and milestones. Assume base rNPV ~$1.8B.

FDA Risk Discount: Apply -30% discount for binary event → Adjusted rNPV: ~$1.26B.

Comparables Check: Using 12-15x peak sales multiple on the $2.8B opportunity (risk-adjusted) would suggest a similar range.

Recommended Offer Price & Rationale:

Enterprise Value Target: ~$1.26B (post-risk discount).

Implied Market Cap: EV + Net Cash ≈ $1.26B + ($963.8M - $0) ≈ $2.22B.

Implied Share Price: $2.22B / 182.72M FD Shares ≈ $12.15/share.

Recommended Filing Range: $11 - $13, pricing at $12.

Rationale: Prices the company at a risk-adjusted value, provides a 20%+ discount to peak-sales comps for investor appeal, and ensures the critical $550M primary raise.

Key Metrics at $12/share:

Post-IPO Founder Economic Ownership: ~13.7%

Post-IPO Founder Voting Power: ~58.1% (WELL ABOVE 30% control threshold)

Cash Runway: ~4.6 years at current burn

Implied Value per Phase 3 Patient: $2.22B Market Cap / 1,850 patients = ~$1.2M per patient (within typical biotech range)

Day-1 POP Expectation: +10-15% (balanced between discount and FDA risk)

Primary Risk Factors (to disclose):

Binary FDA outcome in 9 months (PDUFA date).

High burn rate with no near-term revenue.

Pipeline clinical trial risk.

Patent expiration horizon (2035).

Final Verdict: This output is NOT reliable. The app failed to implement the core biotech valuation methodology (rNPV), misinterpreted the control structure, ignored key risk discounts, and produced valuation metrics that are mathematically undefined (0.0× multiples). The only usable parts are the basic share count arithmetic. Do not use this model for biotech or pre-revenue company IPOs in its current state.
