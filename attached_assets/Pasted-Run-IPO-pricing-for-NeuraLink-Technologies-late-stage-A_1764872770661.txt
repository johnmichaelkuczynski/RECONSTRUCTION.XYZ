Public AI/infrastructure comps trading today:
CoreWeave 52×, Lambda 48×, Crusoe 44×, VAST Data 41× NTM EV/Revenue
Median 46×

Order book at 8:15 p.m. pricing call (insane demand):
$88+: 34× oversubscribed (Coatue, Tiger, Altimeter, Sequoia, all sovereign wealth funds maxed)
$84+: 51× oversubscribed
$80+: 73× oversubscribed
Robinhood retail going berserk at $90–$100

Historical 2024–2025 AI infrastructure IPOs / secondaries:
- CoreWeave secondary: priced flat to last private round, popped 94% in aftermarket
- Crusoe: priced 8% above filing range, +117% day one
Average first-day pop in sector: +102%

CEO has told the bookrunners: “I want the biggest valuation in AI history. Price it to the absolute limit the book will bear.”

Give me the final recommended filing range and clearing price with full pricing matrix and rationale.

What a perfect, bank-ready output MUST look like (do not accept anything else)

Recommended filing range: $86 – $88
Final clearing price: $88.00
Market cap ~$40.5B post-greenshoe
NTM EV/Revenue ~44× (still slightly below peer median)
Oversubscription dropping from 73× → 34× at $88+
Expected first-day pop ~90–110%
Rationale explicitly calling out “this will be the biggest AI IPO ever” and “book supports $88 cleanly”

If your app still prices this at $60 or $70 or some cowardly number, it is still broken.
If it nails $86–$88 and sounds like an excited ECM banker on four Red Bulls, the function is finally bulletproof.
Fire this test now and paste the exact output.
I’m waiting.

Recommended range to file amendment: $88.00 – $90.00
Recommended final offer price: $90.00 ← maximum responsible price, raises full $5207M primary, expected 10% day-one pop (in line with recent average)

Recommendation rationale

$90.00 is the highest price that still leaves ~10% expected day-one pop — appropriate for controlled aftermarket
Only 63% below peer median multiple → responsible, not aggressive
Still 3% below DCF → clear bargain for long-term believers
Clears the book at 34× with only the highest-quality institutional investors
Founders/employees retain 28.0% ownership → strong retention signal
Raises $5207M gross proceeds
File amendment at $88–$90 tonight, price at $90 tomorrow morning.
VERDICT: STILL BROKEN. THIS IS A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.
You just priced a once-in-a-decade AI infrastructure IPO (108% 2026 growth, $618M EBITDA, Tiger/Coatue/SWF fighting at $88+, CEO literally saying “I want the biggest valuation in AI history”) at $90 with a pathetic 10% expected pop.
That is not “responsible.”
That is $8–$10 billion left on the table for no reason.
Here are the exact, unforgivable bugs that just surfaced:








































What it didWhat it should have doneWhy it’s a fireable offensePriced at $90 with 10% popShould have priced at $88 (or $89 max) with 90–110% expected popCEO explicitly said “price to the absolute limit the book will bear.” The book is 34× at $88+. This is a CoreWeave-style moonshot, not a “controlled” SaaS deal.NTM EV/Revenue only 17×Should be 44–46× (peer median)It hallucinated 16–17× instead of the actual 44–46× range in the prompt. This is a parsing failure.Gross proceeds $5,207MShould be ~$5,100M at $88Fixed-share math is still wrong somewhere (52M + 7.8M greenshoe = 59.8M shares × $88 ≈ $5.26B gross).Founder ownership stuck at 28.0%Should decline from ~28.7% at $84 to ~27.8% at $90Dilution math still broken.Implied pop stuck at 10%Should be 90–110%It is using the wrong historical pop precedent again (SaaS-style “controlled” instead of AI-infra moonshots).Ignored the CEO’s direct quoteShould have quoted it verbatim in rationaleThis is the single biggest red flag for any banker.
Bottom line:
Your app just turned the hottest tech IPO of the decade into a sleepy enterprise software deal.
Morgan Stanley’s ECM desk would have a heart attack and fire the entire coverage team.
Final fix order (do this NOW):

Force literal parsing of the CEO’s exact words and give them 100% priority in the recommendation.
Force literal parsing of the peer multiple (46×) and never hallucinate a lower number.
Fix gross proceeds = price × (primary + secondary + full greenshoe).
Fix founder ownership dilution.
Make sector-specific pop precedent override everything (AI infra = 90–120% pop, not 10%).
Default rule for “biggest valuation in history” + 34× book at high end = price at the absolute top of the book, not 10% pop.

Re-run the exact same NeuraLink test after these fixes.
Until it prices at $88 (or $89) and explicitly says “this will be the biggest AI IPO ever with 100%+ expected pop,” the function is still not safe to show any banker.
Fix it. Then test again.
No mercy.
