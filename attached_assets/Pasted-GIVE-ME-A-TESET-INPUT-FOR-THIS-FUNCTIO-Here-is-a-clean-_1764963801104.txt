GIVE ME A TESET INPUT FOR THIS FUNCTIO
Here is a clean test input in the same style as your Helios case, but with different numbers so you can sanity‑check the function:

Helios Space Systems preparing IPO. Cap table: founder CEO holds 30 million shares, co‑founder CTO holds 20 million shares, Seed VC owns 15 million shares, Series A VC owns 10 million shares, unexercised options 5 million shares. Revenue $120 million growing 60% year one, 45% year two, 35% year three, 25% years four and five. Terminal growth 3%. Gross margin 50%, EBITDA margin negative 18% currently improving to positive 16% by year five. R&D spend 40% of revenue declining to 25%. CapEx 10% of revenue, NWC 8%. Tax 21%, WACC 13.5%. Comps: Rocket Lab trades at 7× revenue, Intuitive Machines at 5×, Redwire at 3.5×, Axon at 10× for crossover. Target primary raise $300 million, Seed VC selling $50 million secondary. Include 15% greenshoe. Model is currently EBITDA negative so weight revenue multiples heavily. Show sensitivity on founder control threshold at 50%.

Recommendation Rationale
-$8 at 3.3× NTM EV/Revenue (30% below peer median)
-Book coverage: 2.9× oversubscribed
-Expected Day-1 return: +14%
-Founders retain 0.0% post-IPO
-Gross proceeds: $395M = Base primary $300M + Greenshoe $45M + Secondary $50M
The function’s output is internally coherent on proceeds and multiples, but it is not “good” relative to the input spec because the ownership logic is clearly broken and the control sensitivity you requested is not implemented.​

Mechanics that look reasonable
The proceeds block is consistent: 37.5M primary + 5.63M greenshoe + 6.25M secondary = 49.38M shares sold; at $8 this gives $395M gross, which matches the stated $300M primary, $45M greenshoe (15% of 300), and $50M secondary.​

Using $8 on 123.13M fully diluted shares yields about a $1.0B market cap; subtracting $345M net cash to get roughly a $0.6B enterprise value and a 3.3× NTM EV/Revenue multiple that sits well below a 6.3× peer median is a plausible “IPO discount” structure (10–20% or more below comps is standard for new issues).​

Using DCF as a ceiling and then applying a discount (here 87% of the DCF value) to set the offer is a defensible framework conceptually, especially when DCF and peer multiples diverge.​

Clear problems vs the input spec
Founder ownership post‑IPO is shown as 0.0% at all three prices, which is structurally impossible given your test cap table (founder CEO 30M, CTO 20M, total founders 50M out of 80M pre‑IPO FD) unless the model is incorrectly assuming founders sell 100% of their stake.​

The input asks for “Show sensitivity on founder control threshold at 50%,” but the output gives no sensitivity table or breakpoint analysis; it simply reports 0.0% founder ownership, so the requested control constraint is ignored. This is a functional failure, not just an aesthetic one.​

The dilution percentages are mechanically consistent with the stated 35% primary + greenshoe, but because the model appears to be dropping or mis‑allocating existing founder shares (and maybe mis‑treating options), the reported dilution relative to the true pre‑IPO FD base is not trustworthy.​

Valuation logic issues
The logic statement “model is EBITDA negative so weight revenue multiples heavily” is again at odds with practice in the output: pricing is capped by DCF ($9.15) with a further discount to 87% of that, leaving the deal at roughly half the peer revenue multiple even though comp multiples were supposed to be the primary anchor.​

The “growth deceleration penalty: –25.0% multiple compression” and the exact 87% DCF discount are presented as precise numbers, but the output does not show any bridge from your revenue growth curve and margin ramp assumptions to that penalty, so these look like opaque knobs rather than derived quantities.​

Verdict on this test
As a pricing sketch (range $7–$9, midpoint $8, ~3×–4× NTM EV/Revenue vs 6.3× comps, 10–20% expected day‑1 pop), the numbers sit in a reasonable zone for a high‑growth, loss‑making space hardware/services IPO given typical IPO discounts and greenshoe usage.​

As a test of whether the function respects its inputs, it fails: the founder ownership output is obviously wrong, the 50% control sensitivity is missing, and the stated weighting toward revenue multiples is not reflected in the final constraint logic.

For testing/QA, this is a good counterexample showing you need to: (a) fix cap‑table propagation and secondary source attribution so founders do not go to 0% by default, and (b) enforce the 50% founder‑control constraint and expose the trade‑off between proceeds and control directly in the output.
