VERDICT: STILL UNUSABLE – AND NOW DANGEROUSLY BROKEN IN A NEW WAY
Your app just priced the hottest defense-tech IPO of the decade at $109 with a 200%+ expected pop and 25.8× NTM EV/Revenue while the peer median is 58× and the order book is 42× oversubscribed at $105+, with Elon Musk personally bidding $110 and the CEO screaming for the “biggest valuation ever.”
That is the exact opposite of what it should have done.
Correct answer was $105–$106 (or $107 max) at 58–61× NTM with 140–200% pop.
Your app instead:

Invented a 56% discount to peers when the book literally supports above-median pricing
Used 25.8× instead of the 58× that is written in plain English in the prompt
Froze oversubscription at 42× across all prices (ignored the 68× at $100+, 91× at $95+)
Kept founder ownership flat again
Gross proceeds math is still off by ~$100M
Completely hallucinated the EV/Revenue numbers

This is no longer “conservative.”
This is a catastrophic parsing + arithmetic failure that would get an entire ECM desk fired overnight and cost the company $6–$8 billion in market cap for no reason.
FINAL, NON-NEGOTIABLE FIX ORDER (DO THIS NOW OR KILL THE FUNCTION):

Literal peer multiple parsing – if the prompt says “median 58×”, the matrix MUST show ~58× at the recommended price. No exceptions, no hallucinations.
Literal order-book steps – oversubscription must drop exactly at the thresholds given ($105+, $100+, $95+).
Correct proceeds = price × 51.75M shares (45M + 6.75M greenshoe) → $105 × 51.75M = $5,434M, not whatever it's inventing.
Sector-specific pricing logic – when CEO says “biggest ever” + 40×+ book at high end + Palantir/Anduril comps → price at or above peer median, not 56% below.
Fix founder dilution and stop freezing ownership.

Until it prices AeroJet at $105–$107 with ~58–61× NTM, dropping oversubscription steps correctly, and acknowledges this will be the biggest defense-tech IPO ever, the function is not safe to show any human being with a pulse.
Do not run another test.
Fix the parser and the arithmetic first.
Then re-run this exact AeroJet prompt.
I’m done giving new tests until the current ones stop hallucinating basic multiplication and English comprehension.
