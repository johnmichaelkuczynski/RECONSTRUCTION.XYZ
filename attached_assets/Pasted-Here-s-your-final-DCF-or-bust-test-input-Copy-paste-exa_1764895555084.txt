Here’s your final “DCF or bust” test input.
Copy-paste exactly as-is and run IPO Pricing:
textFORCE RESET ALL CONTEXT
SECTOR: Profitable Consumer Staples / Restaurant Chain
CEO PRIORITY: Balanced – clean execution, no drama, 10-20% Day-1 pop is fine.

Company: GrillMaster Holdings Inc. – fast-casual grilled chicken chain, 1,150 locations
LTM Sep-2025:
Revenue $1.85B (+18% YoY)
EBITDA $296M (16.0% margin)
FCF $218M
Net cash $165M, zero debt

Projections (company guidance):
2025E revenue $2.15B (+16%)
2026E $2.45B (+14%)
2027E $2.78B (+13%)
2028E $3.08B (+11%)
2029E $3.36B (+9%)
Terminal growth 3% thereafter

EBITDA margin 16.5% → 18.0% by 2029 and flat
CapEx 5% of revenue flat
SBC negligible post-IPO
Tax rate 26%
NWC –5 days (negative working capital)
WACC 8.5%

Pre-IPO fully-diluted shares: 184.6 million
Last private round 18 months ago: $62.00/share
Desired gross proceeds: $680M – $720M (up to 20% secondary OK)
15% greenshoe

Use 2025 restaurant comps only (median 8.8× NTM EV/EBITDA, 22× NTM FCF)
Price for clean 12-18% first-day pop. DO NOT apply biotech or growth-deceleration penalties.
Run it.
If the DCF line still says $0.00, that’s the last remaining critical bug.
If it shows a real DCF/share number (should be ~$78–$88), you’re 100% fixed.

File amendment at $22–$25 tonight, price at $24 tomorrow morning.HERE ARE THE EXACT REMAINING FIXES THAT MUST BE MADE (NO COMMENTARY):

DCF engine still broken on multiples path – forces valuation to exactly the offer price ($24.00 = 100%) instead of independent calculation
Peer median detection completely dead (shows 0.0× for restaurant comps)
Context retention still leaking biotech down-round logic (–61.3% down-round alert on profitable restaurant)
Original filed range hallucinated ($22–$25 never mentioned in input)
Founder ownership post-IPO stuck at 0.0% (ignores actual ownership)
NTM EV/Revenue multiple absurdly low (2.0× for a restaurant chain)
Aggressive down-round penalty applied despite explicit “no drama” CEO priority
Order book tiers finally working but still using low-price biotech template
Valuation methodology defaulting to revenue multiple instead of EV/EBITDA or FCF (wrong for consumer staples)
WACC / growth inputs ignored in final valuation

The DCF is now producing a number, but it’s reverse-engineered from the offer price instead of driving it. The rest is still contaminated with biotech baggage.
Module is still not fixed for non-biotech companies.
