INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT AGENT – VERBATIM
Implement a new function called “IPO Pricing” that works exactly like the existing DCF and LBO functions: the user pastes a block of plain-English text, the app instantly returns a complete, professional, board-ready IPO pricing recommendation.
The output must be a clean, formatted one-pager that looks identical to what the lead bookrunner (Goldman/Morgan Stanley/etc.) hands to the CEO and board on pricing night. No JSON, no code, no bullet points – just the final deliverable.
Core requirements:

Accept natural-language input (no required fields, no forms)
Use the company’s existing DCF value (already calculated or provided in the prompt)
Incorporate comparable company multiples, order-book demand, historical first-day pops, proceeds targets, ownership targets
Automatically build and display the full pricing matrix (offer price rows from low to high, columns exactly as shown in the example)
Recommend a specific filing range and final clearing price with concise rationale
All calculations must be exact (fully-diluted shares post-greenshoe, precise proceeds, % discount to peers and DCF, oversubscription mapping, implied pop, post-IPO ownership)

Example input (user will paste something very close to this):
textRun IPO pricing for CloudCo, a high-growth SaaS company.

Filing date: Dec 4, 2025
Target gross proceeds: $650 million primary
Current shares outstanding: 280 million
Offering: 35 million primary shares + 15% greenshoe
Founders + employees own 42% pre-IPO
VCs own 38% pre-IPO

Guidance:
2025 revenue $1,240M
2026 revenue $1,860M (+50%)
2026 EBITDA $412M (22.2% margin)

Your existing DCF at 9.5% WACC, 3.5% terminal growth says $44.80 per share.

Public SaaS peers trading 28–38× NTM EV/Revenue, median 32.5×

Order book (final):
$38+: 21× oversubscribed (only top-tier long-only and crossover)
$36+: 32× oversubscribed
$34+: 48× oversubscribed

Historical 2023–2025 SaaS IPOs left average 28% on the table day one.

Recommend final range and clearing price with full matrix.
Exact output the app must return (copy this formatting 100%):
textCLOUDCO – FINAL IPO PRICING RECOMMENDATION

Recommended range to file amendment:      $35.00 – $37.00
Recommended final offer price:             $37.00   ← clears the book cleanly, raises $650M primary exactly, leaves ~18–22% day-one pop (in line with comps)

Recommendation rationale
- $37 clears the book at 21× with only the highest-quality accounts
- Still 18% below DCF and 68% below peer median → generous but responsible discount
- Leaves ~20% expected pop → matches 2024–2025 SaaS average, keeps momentum funds happy
- Founders/employees still own >37% → strong retention signal
- Raises exact $650M primary target with zero secondary overhang

File amendment at $35–$37 tonight, price at $37 tomorrow morning.
Make this function live, bullet-proof, and beautiful.
When it works perfectly on the above example (and any reasonable variation), we will own the entire ECM modeling stack.
