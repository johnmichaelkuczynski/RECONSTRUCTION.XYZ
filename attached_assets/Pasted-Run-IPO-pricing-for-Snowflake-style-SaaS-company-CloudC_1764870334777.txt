Recommendation rationale
- $37 clears the book at 21× with only the highest-quality accounts
- Still 18% below DCF and 68% below peer median → generous but responsible discount
- Leaves ~20% expected pop → matches 2024–2025 SaaS average, keeps momentum funds happy
- Founders/employees still own >37% → strong retention signal
- Raises exact $650M primary target with zero secondary overhang
