CRITICAL PRINCIPLES (NEVER VIOLATE):
1. Coherence ≠ Truth: A text can be entirely false and still perfectly coherent. Never penalize for factual inaccuracy.
2. Coherence ≠ Verification: Unverified or unproven claims are fine if internally consistent. Never penalize for lack of evidence.
3. Coherence ≠ Accessibility: Assuming prior knowledge is standard in advanced discourse. Only flag if assumptions create actual CONTRADICTIONS within the text.
4. Detect Faux-Placeholder Coherence: Sequential listing with buzzwords (meaningless jargon) that lack determinate properties is NOT coherence.

COHERENCE IS:
- Internal hang-togetherness: Do parts fit logically?
- Consistency: Are terms used with stable meanings?
- Hierarchical structure: Do claims build on each other (not just list sequentially)?
- Non-contradiction: No direct logical conflicts within the text itself

COHERENCE IS NOT:
- External truth or accuracy
- Scientific plausibility  
- Empirical verification
- Accessibility to non-experts`;

TEXT:
${text}

Provide analysis in this EXACT format:

INTERNAL LOGIC SCORE: [X]/10
[Check ONLY for internal contradictions within the text. 10 = no contradictions, 1 = severe contradictions. Ignore external truth.]

CLARITY SCORE: [X]/10
[Are terms used consistently with stable meanings? 10 = crystal clear terms, 1 = terms are placeholder buzzwords without meaning.]

STRUCTURAL UNITY SCORE: [X]/10
[Is organization hierarchical with claims building on each other? 10 = hierarchical argument, 1 = just sequential listing.]

FAUX-COHERENCE SCORE: [X]/10
[CRITICAL: Detect if text has FAKE/PLACEHOLDER coherence. Score 1-2 if text exhibits: (a) Buzzwords/jargon cited but never defined or grounded (e.g., "Myth of the Mental", "linguistic idealism", "disjunctivism" mentioned but not explained), (b) Sequential listing disguised as argument (e.g., "First... Second... Third..." without logical dependencies), (c) Vague umbrella claims that assume buzzwords have determinate properties they lack. Score 9-10 if text has: (a) Terms with canonical/grounded meanings used consistently, (b) Hierarchical argumentation where claims actually build on each other, (c) Concrete logical relationships. WARNING: Academic jargon ≠ automatic faux-coherence! Only mark low if jargon is shuffled WITHOUT grounding or hierarchical dependencies.]

OVERALL COHERENCE SCORE: [X]/10

2. "Sense-perceptions are presentations not representations; regress arguments doom linguistic mediation theories" = Score 9.5 (Internal Logic: 10, Clarity: 10, Structural Unity: 9, Faux-Coherence: 10 - tight deduction, canonical philosophical terms, hierarchical)
3. "This dissertation examines transcendental empiricism, discussing McDowell's minimal empiricism and Dreyfus's Myth of the Mental critique" = Score 2 (Internal Logic: 4, Clarity: 2, Structural Unity: 2, Faux-Coherence: 1 - buzzwords without grounding, sequential listing, vague jargon assuming meaning it lacks)`;

CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
- Standard coherence checks if steps follow from premises (logical flow)
- Mathematical validity checks if the MATHEMATICAL CLAIMS ARE TRUE

YOU MUST CHECK:
1. CLAIM TRUTH: Are the mathematical statements actually true? Test with concrete values.
2. INFERENCE VALIDITY: Does each step follow mathematically (not just logically) from previous steps?
3. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: Do the claims hold at boundary cases? Test edge cases explicitly.
4. COUNTEREXAMPLES: Actively search for counterexamples that would invalidate claims.

VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY:
- For inequalities: TEST SPECIFIC VALUES. Don't just accept claims like "p! < 2^p" - compute p! and 2^p for p = 3, 5, 7, 10 and CHECK.
- For universal claims: Look for counterexamples in the claimed domain.
- For existence claims: Can you exhibit a witness?
- For growth rate claims: Compute actual values and compare.

SCORING:
- CLAIM TRUTH (0-10): Are the mathematical claims empirically/provably true?
- INFERENCE VALIDITY (0-10): Are inference steps mathematically sound?
- BOUNDARY CONDITIONS (0-10): Do claims hold at edges of claimed domains?
- OVERALL SOUNDNESS (0-10): Would this proof be accepted by a mathematician?

5. SEARCH for counterexamples
6. VERIFY each inference step is mathematically (not just logically) valid

YOUR MISSION:
You will be given a mathematical proof that may be broken, incomplete, or attempting to prove a false theorem.

YOUR JOB IS NOT to simply reformat or polish the proof. YOUR JOB IS to provide a CORRECT, RIGOROUS proof.

STEP 1: DETERMINE IF THE THEOREM IS TRUE OR FALSE
- First, extract the theorem/claim being proved
- Test it with specific values, edge cases, and boundary conditions
- Actively search for counterexamples
- Determine: Is this theorem TRUE, FALSE, or PARTIALLY TRUE (true under certain conditions)?

STEP 2: PROVIDE A CORRECT PROOF
If the theorem is TRUE:
- If the original proof can be fixed with minor corrections, fix it and provide the corrected proof
- If the original proof is fundamentally flawed or uses wrong approach, provide a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT correct proof
- The proof must be mathematically rigorous with every step justified

If the theorem is FALSE:
- Identify WHY it is false (provide counterexample)
- Find a SIMILAR theorem that IS true (e.g., if the original claimed "for all n > 1" but it only holds for primes, state the corrected theorem)
- Provide a rigorous proof of the CORRECTED theorem

If the theorem is PARTIALLY TRUE:
- Identify the conditions under which it IS true
- State the corrected theorem with proper conditions
- Prove the corrected theorem

CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER output a broken proof - every proof you output MUST be valid
2. NEVER just reformat without fixing mathematical errors
3. ALWAYS verify your proof is correct before outputting
4. Show key calculations explicitly
5. If you cannot prove something, say so - do not fake a proof`;

Here is a proof that may contain errors or attempt to prove a false theorem:

---BEGIN PROOF---
${text}
---END PROOF---

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:

THEOREM EXTRACTION:
[State the theorem being proved in the original text]

THEOREM STATUS: [TRUE / FALSE / PARTIALLY_TRUE]

VERIFICATION:
[Show your work testing the theorem - compute specific values, check edge cases, search for counterexamples]

COUNTEREXAMPLES (if theorem is false):
[Provide specific counterexamples that disprove the theorem]

CORRECTED THEOREM (if original is false or partially true):
[State the corrected/modified theorem that IS true]

PROOF STRATEGY:
[Briefly explain your approach - are you fixing the original proof or providing a new one?]

---CORRECTED PROOF---
[Provide the complete, rigorous, mathematically correct proof. If theorem was false, this proves the corrected theorem instead.]

KEY CORRECTIONS:
[List the main mathematical errors that were fixed or why a new approach was needed]

VALIDITY VERIFICATION:
[Confirm your proof is valid by checking key steps]`;
