# Cognitive Analysis Platform

## Overview
This platform analyzes written text to assess the intelligence and cognitive fingerprint of authors using multi-model AI evaluation. It provides document analysis, AI detection, translation, comprehensive cognitive profiling, and intelligent text rewriting capabilities. The project's vision is to offer deep insights into cognitive abilities and thought processes from written content, with advanced features for maximizing intelligence scores through iterative rewriting, and also offers professional financial model generation.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application uses a monorepo structure, separating client and server.
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, wouter for routing, React Query for server state, and Chart.js for data visualization.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, integrating multiple LLMs, document processing via Mathpix OCR, speech-to-text with AssemblyAI, and email services via SendGrid.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, storing user, document, analysis, and cognitive profile data.
- **Core Services**: Includes multi-model intelligence evaluation, document comparison, multi-language translation, OCR for mathematical notation, and intelligent text rewriting with custom instructions support.
    - **Intelligence Evaluation**: A 4-phase system with initial assessment, deep analytical questioning across 17 cognitive dimensions (including Conceptual Depth, Inferential Control, Semantic Compression, Novel Abstraction, Cognitive Risk, Authenticity, Symbolic Manipulation), revision, and final pushback.

      - **LBO Model**: Fully implemented with sources/uses, debt schedules, sponsor returns (IRR/MOIC), exit valuation, and 5-year projections.
      - **M&A Model**: Fully implemented with comprehensive fixes (December 2024):
        - **Accretion/Dilution Analysis**: Uses acquirerExplicitEPS if user provides it directly (e.g., "earns $3.20 per share") instead of recalculating.
        - **Sources & Uses**: Now balances exactly. Includes explicit or calculated transaction fees. Cash from balance sheet auto-adjusts to balance.
        - **Goodwill Calculation**: Correct formula: Purchase Price - Fair Value Net Assets - Identified Intangibles.
        - **Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) Tab**: New Excel tab with breakdown of customer relationships, developed technology, other intangibles, and amortization schedules.
        - **Debt Schedule Tab**: New Excel tab with beginning/ending balance, mandatory amortization, and interest expense by year.

        - **Interest Expense**: Properly calculated from debt schedule and included in pro forma projections.
        - Features separate phase-in schedules for revenue synergies (default: 0/50/100/100/100%) and cost synergies (default: 20/60/100/100/100%).
      - **IPO Pricing Model**: Fully implemented with comprehensive pricing analysis and **Enhanced Multi-Instrument Engine (December 2024)**:
        - **Discount Bug Fix (December 2024)**: Changed `||` to `??` for discount parsing to allow 0% discount. JavaScript falsy value issue fixed - 0% discount no longer defaults to 20%.
        - **Share Count Fix (December 2024)**: Added `newPrimaryShares` and `userGreenshoeShares` fields for direct user input. Correct formula: `offerPrice = discountedPreMoneyValuation / (preIPO + newPrimary + greenshoe)`
        - **Valuation Methods**: Revenue multiple (default), EBITDA multiple, or multi-proxy blended (weighted array of multiples)
        - **Pricing Calculation**: Pre-money valuation, theoretical share price, offer price with IPO discount
        - **Offer Structure**: Primary shares issued, secondary shares sold, greenshoe (over-allotment) option
        - **Proceeds Analysis**: Gross/net primary proceeds, secondary proceeds, underwriting fees
        - **Dilution Analysis**: Post-IPO shares outstanding, percentage sold, existing holder dilution
        - **Trading Metrics**: Market cap at offer, expected first-day pop
        - **Excel Export**: Multi-tab workbook with full walkthrough and enhanced instrument analysis
        - **Unit Normalization**: Automatic handling of LLM parsing inconsistencies. Dollar amounts >10,000 auto-convert to millions; share counts >1,000 auto-convert to millions.
        - **ENHANCED MULTI-INSTRUMENT ENGINE (December 2024)**: New `ipoInstrumentEngine.ts` handles complex scenarios:
          - **Multiple Convertible Instruments**: Supports arrays of SAFEs, venture debt, loans with different triggers:
            - `lower_of`: Converts at lower of fixed price or % of IPO (e.g., "lower of $18 or 80% of IPO")
            - `price_gt/price_gte`: Conditional conversion if IPO price exceeds threshold (e.g., "converts if IPO > $25")
            - `at_ipo_price`: Converts at final IPO price
            - `fixed_shares`: Fixed share conversion regardless of price
            - `conditional`: Probability-weighted conversion (e.g., "70% probability of FDA approval")
          - **Probability-Weighted Contingencies**: Earnouts, performance warrants, litigation, grants with probabilities:
            - Share-based contingencies: Expected shares = shares × probability
            - Cash-based contingencies: Expected cost = payment × probability (reduces valuation)
            - Warrants with strikes: Cost = (IPO - strike) × shares × probability
          - **Strategic Deals with Premiums**: Partners paying IPO + X% premium (not just IPO price)
          - **Anchor Orders as Demand Boost**: Sovereign wealth funds, cornerstone investors boost pricing confidence:
            - Formula: demandBoost = 1.0 + min(anchorAmount / raiseTarget × 0.2, 0.20)
          - **Employee Option Dilution (Treasury Stock Method)**:
            - If strike < offer: Net dilution = options - (options × strike / offer price)
          - **Multi-Proxy Blended Valuation with Growth Premium**: Weighted array of multiples with growth adjustment:
            - Base blended multiple = sum of (each multiple × its weight)
            - Example: 48x × 60% + 24x × 40% = 28.8x + 9.6x = 38.4x base
            - Growth premium: If revenue growth > threshold (default 200%), applies premium (e.g., 15%)
            - Effective multiple = 38.4x × 1.15 = 44.16x for high-growth companies
        - **Processing Order (Correct Sequence)**: Blended valuation → Anchor boost → Convertibles → Contingencies → Employee options → Final pricing
        - **Dual-Class Share Voting Control**: Calculates founder voting power vs public, generates CRITICAL warning if control threshold breached
        - **Backward Compatible**: Legacy single-instrument fields still supported for simple cases

        - **Cash Flow Statement**: Operating (CFO), Investing (CFI), Financing (CFF) activities with Free Cash Flow
        - **Circular Reference Handling**: Iterative calculation for revolver draws/paydowns and cash balancing
        - **Supporting Schedules**: Debt Schedule, Working Capital, PP&E, Shareholders' Equity
        - **Ratio Analysis**: 50+ ratios across profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency, growth, per-share metrics
        - **Charts Data**: Pre-formatted tables for Revenue/EBITDA, Leverage, EPS visualization
        - **Balance Sheet Reconciliation (December 2024 Fix)**: Implements standard financial modeling "plug" mechanism using cash as balancing item. Ensures Assets = Liabilities + Equity across all periods (0-5) by: (1) anchoring historical assets to user input, (2) adjusting retained earnings to force period 0 balance, (3) propagating retained earnings adjustment through forward periods, (4) applying cash plug for any remaining imbalance per period.
      - Default LLM: Zhi 5 (Grok) using grok-3 model for finance models.
      - **GUARANTEED PARSER ARCHITECTURE (December 2024)**: Complete bulletproof parsing system that eliminates undefined values:
        - **Core Principle**: Every required field has a guaranteed value - either extracted from user input or filled with sensible defaults
        - **Architecture**: Regex extraction (PRIMARY) → LLM parsing (SUPPLEMENTARY) → Hardcoded defaults (FALLBACK)
        - **Key File**: `server/services/guaranteedParser.ts` provides `parseLBOGuaranteed()`, `parseMAGuaranteed()`, `parseDCFGuaranteed()`, `parseIPOGuaranteed()`, `parseThreeStatementGuaranteed()`
        - **Default Value Sets**: Complete default values for all models (LBO_DEFAULTS, MA_DEFAULTS, DCF_DEFAULTS, IPO_DEFAULTS, THREE_STATEMENT_DEFAULTS)
