# Cognitive Analysis Platform

## Overview
This platform analyzes written text to assess the intelligence and cognitive fingerprint of authors using multi-model AI evaluation. It provides document analysis, AI detection, translation, comprehensive cognitive profiling, and intelligent text rewriting capabilities. The project's vision is to offer deep insights into cognitive abilities and thought processes from written content, with advanced features for maximizing intelligence scores through iterative rewriting, and also offers professional financial model generation.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application uses a monorepo structure, separating client and server.
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, wouter for routing, React Query for server state, and Chart.js for data visualization.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, integrating multiple LLMs, document processing via Mathpix OCR, speech-to-text with AssemblyAI, and email services via SendGrid.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, storing user, document, analysis, and cognitive profile data.
- **Core Services**: Includes multi-model intelligence evaluation, document comparison, multi-language translation, OCR for mathematical notation, and intelligent text rewriting with custom instructions support.
    - **Intelligence Evaluation**: A 4-phase system with initial assessment, deep analytical questioning across 17 cognitive dimensions (including Conceptual Depth, Inferential Control, Semantic Compression, Novel Abstraction, Cognitive Risk, Authenticity, Symbolic Manipulation), revision, and final pushback. Supports genre-aware assessment.
    - **Intelligent Rewrite Function (MAXINTEL)**: Recursively optimizes text to maximize intelligence scores, supporting custom instructions and optional external knowledge integration.
    - **GPT Bypass Humanizer**: Transforms 100% AI-generated text to 0% AI detection.
    - **Coherence Meter**: Offers two processing strategies (simple chunking, outline-guided) with adjustable aggressiveness, and a dedicated `math-proof-validity` mode for mathematical correctness verification.
    - **Text Model Validator**: Includes "Truth Select" for truth-value isomorphism and "Math Truth Select" for rigorous first-order model theory and truth-grounded model searching, both supporting literal truth verification. Users can select which AI model powers validation (ZHI 1-5), defaulting to Grok (ZHI 5).
    - **AI Chat Assistant**: Features full conversation history tracking and Zhi Database integration for contextual philosophical content.
    - **Conservative Reconstruction**: "Charitable Interpretation" mode produces self-contained, coherent essays articulating a text's unified argument.
    - **Finance Panel**: Generates professional Excel financial models from natural language input, producing value-based workbooks with executive summaries, assumptions, projections, valuations, and sensitivity analysis.
      - **DCF Model**: Fully implemented with 3 valuation scenarios (Bear/Base/Bull), 5-year projections, and sensitivity analysis.
      - **LBO Model**: Fully implemented with sources/uses, debt schedules, sponsor returns (IRR/MOIC), exit valuation, and 5-year projections.
      - **M&A Model**: Fully implemented with comprehensive fixes (December 2024):
        - **Accretion/Dilution Analysis**: Uses acquirerExplicitEPS if user provides it directly (e.g., "earns $3.20 per share") instead of recalculating.
        - **Sources & Uses**: Now balances exactly. Includes explicit or calculated transaction fees. Cash from balance sheet auto-adjusts to balance.
        - **Goodwill Calculation**: Correct formula: Purchase Price - Fair Value Net Assets - Identified Intangibles.
        - **Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) Tab**: New Excel tab with breakdown of customer relationships, developed technology, other intangibles, and amortization schedules.
        - **Debt Schedule Tab**: New Excel tab with beginning/ending balance, mandatory amortization, and interest expense by year.
        - **Revenue Synergy Margin**: Applies flow-through margin (e.g., 50%) to revenue synergies for EBITDA impact. Default 100% if not specified.
        - **Interest Expense**: Properly calculated from debt schedule and included in pro forma projections.
        - Features separate phase-in schedules for revenue synergies (default: 0/50/100/100/100%) and cost synergies (default: 20/60/100/100/100%).
      - **IPO Pricing Model**: Fully implemented (December 2024) with comprehensive pricing analysis:
        - **Valuation Methods**: Revenue multiple (default), EBITDA multiple, or blended (weighted average)
        - **Pricing Calculation**: Pre-money valuation, theoretical share price, offer price with IPO discount
        - **Offer Structure**: Primary shares issued, secondary shares sold, greenshoe (over-allotment) option
        - **Proceeds Analysis**: Gross/net primary proceeds, secondary proceeds, underwriting fees
        - **Dilution Analysis**: Post-IPO shares outstanding, percentage sold, existing holder dilution
        - **Trading Metrics**: Market cap at offer, expected first-day pop
        - **Excel Export**: 3-tab workbook (Summary, Assumptions, Calculation Steps) with full walkthrough
        - **Formulas**: Pre-Money = LTM Revenue × Multiple; Theoretical Price = Pre-Money / Pre-IPO Shares; Offer Price = Theoretical × (1 - Discount)
        - **Unit Normalization (December 2024 Fix)**: Automatic handling of LLM parsing inconsistencies. Dollar amounts >10,000 auto-convert to millions; share counts >1,000 auto-convert to millions. Prevents billion-scale errors.
        - **Convertible Debt Treatment**: Tracks trigger price, debt amount, conversion shares. If offer price exceeds trigger, converts debt to equity, adds conversion shares to pre-IPO count, recalculates final offer price with dilution. Full Excel integration showing activation status.
        - **Dual-Class Share Voting Control (December 2024)**: Calculates founder voting power (founder shares × vote multiplier) vs public votes (non-founder shares × 1). Compares against user-specified control threshold. Generates CRITICAL warning if founders lose voting control post-IPO. Includes Governance section in Excel export with voting breakdown and status (SECURED/BREACHED).

        - **Ratio Analysis**: 50+ ratios across profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency, growth, per-share metrics
        - **Charts Data**: Pre-formatted tables for Revenue/EBITDA, Leverage, EPS visualization
        - **Balance Sheet Reconciliation (December 2024 Fix)**: Implements standard financial modeling "plug" mechanism using cash as balancing item. Ensures Assets = Liabilities + Equity across all periods (0-5) by: (1) anchoring historical assets to user input, (2) adjusting retained earnings to force period 0 balance, (3) propagating retained earnings adjustment through forward periods, (4) applying cash plug for any remaining imbalance per period.
